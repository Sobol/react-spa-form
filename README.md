## React SPA form application

Simple react app created via create-react-app. 

### React related

[Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - Awesome library. React Bootstrap 4 components. Docs could be a bit better tho...

[React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. 

[HolderJS](http://holderjs.com/) - JS lib for fast and easy placeholders.

### Storage

Project uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store all the info provided by user.
It might be a good idea to add restriction for the image size due to the fact local storage has 10MB max capacity.

Could be replaced with [React Native Fetch API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html) to any backend API.

### Testing

I will add some test in close future. Yeah I know TDD...

### Additional note

Why [React](https://reactjs.org/)? Because I like it :-) It's easy funn and simple to learn/use. Perfect for small SPA apps like this, but also a good and solid solution for huge applications.

Facebook can't be wrong after all... righ?
